## Overview

This template uses Stripe Checkout for payments and a credit ledger to grant usage credits after purchase.

- UI: `/[locale]/pricing` shows plans from a typed config.
- Create session: client calls `POST /api/checkout` to create a Stripe Checkout session and redirects to Stripe.
- Redirect back: Stripe sends the user to `/api/pay/callback/stripe` (GET) after checkout.
- Finalize server-side: Stripe sends a webhook to `/api/pay/webhook/stripe` (POST). The webhook marks the order paid and grants credits.

The webhook is the source of truth; the callback is only for browser navigation and is safe to keep as a secondary path (code is idempotent if it runs twice).

---

## Endpoints

- `/api/checkout` (POST):
  - Validates the selected plan against `src/data/pricing.ts`.
  - Creates a Stripe Checkout session (inline price data; no Stripe Products required).
  - Inserts an `orders` row with status `created` and returns `checkout_url`.

- `/api/pay/callback/stripe` (GET):
  - Used by Stripe Checkout success redirect. Fetches the session for logging, then redirects the user to your success or failure page.
  - Note: Server-of-record updates happen in the webhook.

- `/api/pay/webhook/stripe` (POST):
  - Verifies the Stripe signature.
  - Handles `checkout.session.completed` and calls `handleCheckoutSession` to mark the order paid and grant credits.

## Credits Flow

On successful payment:

1) We look up the order by `order_no` in session metadata.
2) Update the order to `paid` and persist relevant payment details.
3) Insert a positive ledger row in `credits` (`trans_type: order_pay`) for the purchased amount. The balance reflects non-expired positive entries minus all consumption entries.

## Prerequisites

Set these variables in `.env.local` and restart dev:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...             # Test mode secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...           # From Stripe CLI / dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000 # External URL for callbacks
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_CANCEL_URL=/pricing       # Optional; relative or absolute
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_SUCCESS_URL=/pricing      # Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAY_FAIL_URL=/pricing         # Optional
```

Notes:

- `src/integrations/stripe.ts` expects `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
- If you previously used `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`, replace it with `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.

## Local Webhook Setup

Use the Stripe CLI to forward events to your local endpoint.

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/pay/webhook/stripe
```

When `stripe listen` starts, it prints a `whsec_...` secret — copy it to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Trigger a test checkout completion:

```bash
stripe trigger checkout_session_completed
```

Common gotcha: triggering `payment_intent.succeeded` will hit your webhook but is ignored unless you add a handler for it. This template listens to `checkout.session.completed`.

---

## Try It

1) Sign up and sign in via `/[locale]/signup` and `/[locale]/login`.
2) Visit `/[locale]/pricing` and click a plan.
3) Complete the Stripe Checkout with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
4) Stripe redirects to the callback URL; the webhook finalizes your order and grants credits.
5) Verify credits at `/[locale]/credits-test` or via `POST /api/account/credits`.

If you enable RMB/WeChat Pay, ensure those payment methods are active in your Stripe test account. Otherwise, start with USD + card.

---

## Implementation Details

- Plans live in `src/data/pricing.ts`. Values are typed (`Pricing`), shared by the pricing page and `/api/checkout`.
- Orders are stored in `orders`; credit movements in `credits`.
- The webhook verifies signatures using the raw request body and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- `handleCheckoutSession` supports both one-time and subscription checkouts:
  - Payment mode: uses `session.payment_intent`.
  - Subscription mode: fetches the latest invoice’s payment intent from the subscription.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Add an `invoice.payment_succeeded` handler to grant credits on subscription renewals.
- Persist Stripe IDs (subscription, invoice) alongside orders for richer admin views.
- Add idempotency keys if you extend the flow to multiple writes per event.
